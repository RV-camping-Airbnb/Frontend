## RVNB

RVNB is Airbnb for RV's. It is a platform that connects landowners who have unutilized land to RV owners looking for a place to camp. We bring people together and "Give Land a Home"!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Features

- Users can register/create an account either as a Landowner or an RV Owner.
- Landowners can create, update, and delete listings of their available land.
- RV Owners can query/filter available listings by location and reserve a spot for their desired date(s).
